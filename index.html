            <p>Bangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came in the 1979 ICC Trophy in England. </p>
            On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played its first ODI match, against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. For a long time, football was the most popular sport in Bangladesh, but cricket gradually became very popular – particularly in urban areas – and by the late 1990s had surpassed football.
